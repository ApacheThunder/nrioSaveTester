# NRIO Save Tester: N-Card Save Test Tool

Simple program to test SRAM on N-Cards to make sure battery is still good.


Note. Program may hang on initial boot with fresh save file. If this occurs, just reboot and once XMENU generates a save file, it should operate normally.

On initial boot. Use B button to write test save to SRAM. Once down follow prompt to exit and power down. Leave powered off for a minute, an hour, a day...however long you desire to test.

A good battery should hold a save for at least a day. Though techinically if it holds a save longer then a few minutes you could reasonably get by if you remember to reboot quickly to backup save.

Program will show what the expected CRCs should be and what the CRC's the save tile returned and will indicate accordingly if they do not match.
